This is a proposal I wrote and submitted in February of 2021 for consideration as a graduate student project at the Bren School. The proposal was accepted by the Eco-Entrepreneurship committee. However, I will not be working on this project as a graduate student project.

The proposal focuses on the business and environmental need for financing of small-scale, modular anaerobic digester systems in the dairy industry.
